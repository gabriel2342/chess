## Reflection
This project represents the culmination of TOP data structures and algorithims curriculum. It was challenging to say the least as this was my first real introduction to grpahs. One of my biggest
takeaways was the importance of focusing on the problem at hand. I knew we had a chess project coming up and tried to solve that problem first making my attempt at a solution to knights travails
much more challenging. Once I focused on the problem at hand things ran much smoother. I was able to deppend my understaning of OOP design and have made imrpovements on my approaches towards 
refactoring but still have much more to go.
